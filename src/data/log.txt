response: Checksums are strings generated from content to facilitate comparison, often used for data integrity verification. They can also be used for fast comparisons of large datasets. In the context of your original message, you mentioned using a hash to check if the content of a document has changed. This is an example of applying checksums for data integrity verification.

For instance, in programming, checksums are often generated using algorithms like MD5 or SHA-256 to verify data integrity after transfer or storage. These hashes can be compared with their original values to ensure data consistency and accuracy.

A token might be a sentence like "Dogs are mammals," taken from a larger text about animals. These tokens are then converted into numerical values, because computers process numbers much more efficiently than text. These values are called vectors, which represent points in a multi-dimensional space. This sounds more complicated than it is, you can think about it as a row in an excel sheet where each column is a number in the vector and each row is a separate vector. A vector is just a combination of multiple numbers.\n\n### Encoding\n\nWhen we give input to a language model, like “Explain how an apple grows on a tree,” it’s in human readable text. But computers are better with numbers, so encoding converts this input into numerical data that the model can process efficiently.\n\n### Pattern matching'), Document(metadata={'source': '/app/data/files/amplenote/The magic behind large language models.md'}, page_content='### Pattern matching\n\nOnce the input is converted to vectors (combinations of numbers), the model looks for patterns in these vectors to understand the context of the question. For example, it identifies the relationship between "apple," "grows," and "tree." Then, based on similar patterns it has seen before, the model matches the question with relevant content from its training. If the model was trained on a book about growing fruits, it can pull knowledge from that to respond to the user.\n\n## Decoding: \n\nThe model’s response is initially generated as numerical data, which is better for computational purposes. But humans aren\'t great at reading long strings of numbers, so decoding converts this output back into readable text.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis is a simplified look at how a large language model works, but it covers the basics. This incredible technology has transformed our world, giving everyone access to a personal assistant that knows a lot about all kinds of topics! While it’s not perfect, it’s excellent for simple tasks or for sharing information it’s been trained on.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/app/data/files/amplenote/Large language model.md'}, page_content="---\ntitle: Large language model\nuuid: f9fbd5ce-9fa2-11ef-9c73-ed6fc27f5e9d\nversion: 61\ncreated: '2024-11-10T19:32:59Z'\ntags:\n  - ai\n  - machinelearning\n  - programming\n---\n\nLarge language models have made quite a name for themselves in recent years. The release of ChatGPT was the greatest instigator of this increased popularity, but how does it actually work?\n\n## Concept\n\nA large language model is simply put a model that takes in the question answered, queries the relevant information and based on this information it tries to make a prediction what the appropriate response would be, this prediction is then assessed and if it is deemed correct the response is returned. For this there is multiple steps. These are:\n\n- \\(encoding) Get input and vectorize it: the input needs to be received from the user and vectorized, vectorisation is a conversion of a string to number values which can be more optimally used by the model to find matching patterns\n\n- \\(pattern matching) Find pattern in the vectorised question: the model tries to find specific patterns in the words used to figure out what question is asked"), Document(metadata={'source': '/app/data/files/amplenote/Linear classifier.md'}, page_content="---\ntitle: Linear classifier\nuuid: 50d4d474-cf4e-11ef-b85a-01cf032b2899\nversion: 31\ncreated: '2025-01-10T12:27:41Z'\ntags:\n  - neuralnetwork\n  - ai\n  - machinelearning\n---\n\nA linear classifier is one of the simplest methods to identify data as one of two classes using articial intelligence. A basic linear classifier is used to identify data with 2 features by drawing a line on the two dimensional plane which will separate the two possible classes.\n\n![](images/50d4d474-cf4e-11ef-b85a-01cf032b2899/4ca552db-faca-48e1-bb57-34b55f4ca3ad.png) [^1]\n\nIt works by initially drawing a random line and then changing the rotation and location of the line based on training data. Which will be data that has values for the two features and has the class it belongs to already defined. After training the model to get an accuracte classification over the training data the model will most likely also be accurate on real data, assuming there was enough training data and that the training data was accurate.\n\n[^1]: O\n    O\n    o o\n    O")], 'answer': 'An AI is a field of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent agents – systems that can reason, learn, and act autonomously. It involves developing algorithms and techniques to enable computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of key aspects:\n\n*   **Goal:** To create systems that can solve problems, understand language, and interact with the world in a meaningful way.\n*   **Methods:** AI encompasses a wide range of techniques, including machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.\n*   **Examples:** Self-driving cars, virtual assistants (like Siri or Alexa), spam filters, medical diagnosis tools, and recommendation systems (like those used by Netflix or Amazon).\n\nEssentially, AI aims to mimic human cognitive abilities within machines.'}
