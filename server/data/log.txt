answer: According to your notes, a checksum is a string that is generated based on some content to make a comparisson faster. For instance to check if the content of a document has changed a hash of the complete content using a simple algorithm like md5 can be used to compare the hashes of the saved and the new content.

Checksums make use of the semi random generated hash by algorithms like MD5. Since the hash is a semi random 2^128 this means that the probability of a collision where two different strings generate the same hash is approximately 1/2^128.
